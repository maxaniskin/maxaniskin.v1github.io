                He also carried off well his long duet with Violetta in Act 1, scene 2 except for one or two very low notes which strangely went astray.

                stands by in perplexity at the foot of his epistle, shall to the press or to the sponge. These
                are the pretty responsories, these are the dear antiphonies, that so bewitched of late our
                prelates and their chaplains with the goodly echo they made; and besotted us to the gay

                I hope, for that our English, the language of men ever famous and foremost in the achievements
                of liberty, will not easily find servile letters enow to spell such a dictatory presumption

            <p>And in conclusion it reflects to the disrepute of our ministers also, of whose labours we should
                hope better, and of the proficiency which their flock reaps by them, than that after all this
                light of the Gospel which is, and is to be, and all this continual preaching, they should still
                be frequented with such an unprincipled, unedified and laic rabble, as that the whiff of every
                new pamphlet should stagger them out of their catechism and Christian walking. </p>
            <p>This may have much reason to discourage the ministers when such a low conceit is had of all their
                exhortations, and the benefiting of their hearers, as that they are not thought fit to be turned
                loose to three sheets of paper without a licenser; that all the sermons, all the lectures
                preached, printed, vented in such numbers, and such volumes, as have now well nigh made all
                other books unsaleable, should not be armour enough against one single Enchiridion, without the
                castle of St. Angelo of an Imprimatur.</p>

            <p>They are not skilful considerers of human things, who imagine to remove sin by removing the
                matter of sin; for, besides that it is a huge heap increasing under the very act of diminishing,
                though some part of it may for a time be withdrawn from some persons, it cannot from all, in
                such a universal thing as books are; and when this is done, yet the sin remains entire. Though
                ye take from a covetous man all his treasure, he has yet one jewel left, ye cannot bereave him
                of his covetousness.</p>
            <p> Banish all objects of lust, shut up all youth into the severest discipline that can be exercised
                in any hermitage, ye cannot make them chaste, that came not hither so; such great care and
                wisdom is required to the right managing of this point. Suppose we could expel sin by this
                means; look how much we thus expel of sin, so much we expel of virtue: for the matter of them
                both is the same; remove that, and ye remove them both alike.</p>
